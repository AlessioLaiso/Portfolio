            <h6>The vision</h6>
            <h3>Celebrating sustainability and technology</h3>
            <p>On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the European Space Agency (ESA) wanted to make an exhibition out of its satellite images, to increase awareness towards a more sustainable lifestyle and highlight the potential of space technology. The selected location was Palazzo delle Esposizioni, the largest interdisciplinary exhibition area in the centre of Rome.</p>

            <h6>My role and the team</h6>
            <h3>An agile and multidisciplinary team</h3>
            <p>I was the lead designer for the exhibition held in Rome (Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Sep–Nov 2014) and its identity, including posters and flyers. I worked together with the art director M. Rullo, another designer, and an architect, in addition to the curator from ESA.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="p-between-img">After I left the agency to work for Runtastic, the exhibition was adapted for the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan (May 2015–Jan 2016, to coincide with Expo 2015) and the United Nations General Assembly building in New York (Jul–Sep 2015).</p>

            <h6>The exhibition</h6>
            <h3>Fragility and beauty of the Earth</h3>
            <p>The exhibition revolves around the opposition of fragility and beauty of the planet, and is divided into six main areas: Ice, Water, Atmosphere, Forests and Agriculture, Deserts, and Cities. To make the exhibition more engaging for a younger audience, we decided to use an array of different media, including interactive installations, scale models of satellites, and videos, in addition to the large satellite images ESA provided us with.</p>

            <p class="p-between-img">The satellite images on display are incredibly striking and have a strong visual impact, aimed at creating a dramatic contrast with the actual situations and inviting visitors to the exhibition to reflect on the fragility of our planet, caused by global climate change.</p>

            <h6>Outcomes</h6>
            <h3>An international success story</h3>
            <p>The exhibition in Rome was really appreciated by the public and covered extensively in the press. After I left Vertigo Design, the exhibition was adapted for the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan (during Expo 2015), the United Nations Headquarters in New York (Jul–Sep 2015), and the Palais de la Découverte in Paris (Dec 2015–Jun 2016).</p>

            <p class="p-between-img">“My planet from space” has also won multiple awards, and was included in the renowned ADI Design Index, the publication by the Italian Association for Industrial Design that collects the best of Italian design.</p>
