            <h3>Running ahead of the competition</h3>
            <p>Health and fitness is an extremely competitive space for mobile apps. In a team of four, I was one of the two designers who mostly focused on the Android version of Runtastic. I was also involved in cross-platform user research and user experience discussions, as well as producing designs for A/B testing on iOS and assets like icons and illustrations. We were constantly working on the Runtastic app to further refine the UX and polish the UI, to keep the app an industry leader.</p>
            <h6 id="kudos">Kudos</h6>
            <h3>Award-winning design</h3>
            <p>Shortly after I started working at Runtastic, the company launched the Material Design overhaul of the flagship app. In the following months, we received some feedback from Google and I took the responsibility of redesigning some of the screens as well as designing some news ones. The newly introduced running leaderboard, for example, added an important social element that significantly increased user engagement.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="runtastic-leaderboard-img">Following these updates, the Runtastic app for Android was included in the Editor’s choice collection and was one of the 15 apps included in the Material Design Showcase at Google I/O 2015.</p>

            <h3>Finding a consistent voice</h3>
            <p>Runtastic’s imagery was quite inconsistent when I joined the company. During my time there I produced many illustrations, mostly to be used in the apps, and I led the team effort to find a new style that could be easily used by everyone in the team in a consistent way.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/runtastic/runtastic-illustrations.png" alt="Three illustrations: one with a podium, one with a beach and a volley-ball net, one with a phone with earphones">
                <figcaption>Some in-app illustrations I produced for the Runtastic app.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This tileable pattern for backgrounds was one of the distinctive elements of the new illustration style.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In addition to this, I also designed the next evolution of the Runtastic icon set, optimizing the icons on the pixel grid and using consistent visual traits across over 100 icons.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/runtastic/icons-old-new-set.png" alt="Four icons of the old set compared with the icons from the new set">

                <figcaption>All the icons from the redesigned set are based on a 48px grid and share common visual traits.</figcaption>

            <h3>More love from Google and Facebook</h3>
            <p>In the Spring of 2015 Google UK launched a campaign for Android with the slogan “Be together. Not the same.” Runtastic had a huge featuring in this, and I worked to provide assets for printed billboards, Android.com, promotional videos, and more.</p>

            <p>The Runtastic app was also featured in the “Build better” video series by Facebook, for the F8 conference in 2015. The video tells the story of rapper Masta Ace, and shows how Runtastic is part of his life and the lives of many other people around the world.</p>
