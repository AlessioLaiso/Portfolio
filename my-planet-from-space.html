The selected location was Palazzo delle Esposizioni, the largest interdisciplinary exhibition area in the centre of Rome.</p><figure class="planet-narrow-img"><img alt="The poster of the exhibition hanging between marble columns" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-poster.jpg"><figcaption>The poster of the exhibition at the entrance of the Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Rome.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="my-role-and-the-team">My role and the team</h6><h3>An agile and multidisciplinary team</h3><p>I was the lead designer for the exhibition held in Rome (Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Sep–Nov 2014) and its identity, including posters and flyers. I worked together with the art director M. Rullo, another designer, and an architect, in addition to the curator from ESA.</p><figure><img alt="The section about forests of the exhibition, with images of trees and satellite photos" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-forests.jpg"><figcaption>The section about forests of the exhibition in Rome.</figcaption></figure><p class="p-between-img">After I left the agency to work for Runtastic, the exhibition was adapted for the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan (May 2015–Jan 2016, to coincide with Expo 2015) and the United Nations General Assembly building in New York (Jul–Sep 2015).</p><figure><img alt="The section about deserts of the exhibition, with a cretto-like installation and satellite photos" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-deserts.jpg"><figcaption>The section about deserts of the exhibition in Rome, featuring an installation by the artist and designer Marco Vagnini.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="the-exhibition">The exhibition</h6><h3>Fragility and beauty of the Earth</h3><p>The exhibition revolves around the opposition of fragility and beauty of the planet, and is divided into six main areas: Ice, Water, Atmosphere, Forests and Agriculture, Deserts, and Cities. To make the exhibition more engaging for a younger audience, we decided to use an array of different media, including interactive installations, scale models of satellites, and videos, in addition to the large satellite images ESA provided us with.</p><figure><img alt="The entrance of the exhibition, with two installations representing fragility and beauty" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-fragility-beauty.jpg"><figcaption>“Fragility and beauty” in the exhibition in Rome.</figcaption></figure><figure class="img-between-img"><img alt="A scale model of the satellite among satellite photos" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-satellite.jpg"><figcaption>One of the scale models of satellites in New York.</figcaption></figure><p class="p-between-img">The satellite images on display are incredibly striking and have a strong visual impact, aimed at creating a dramatic contrast with the actual situations and inviting visitors to the exhibition to reflect on the fragility of our planet, caused by global climate change.</p><figure class="img-between-img"><img alt="Satellite photos in the forests section of the exhibition" src="images/my-planet-from-space/my-planet-space-forests-ny.jpg"><figcaption>The section about forests of the exhibition in New York.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h6><h3>An international success story</h3><p>The exhibition in Rome was really appreciated by the public and covered extensively in the press.
