In a team of four, I was one of the two designers who mostly focused on the Android version of Runtastic. I was also involved in cross-platform user research and user experience discussions, as well as producing designs for A/B testing on iOS and assets like icons and illustrations. We were constantly working on the Runtastic app to further refine the UX and polish the UI, to keep the app an industry leader.</p><h6 id="kudos">Kudos</h6><h3>Award-winning design</h3><p>Shortly after I started working at Runtastic, the company launched the Material Design overhaul of the flagship app. In the following months, we received some feedback from Google and I took the responsibility of redesigning some of the screens as well as designing some news ones. The newly introduced running leaderboard, for example, added an important social element that significantly increased user engagement.</p><figure><img alt="The running leaderboard as it appears on Android devices" src="images/runtastic/runtastic-leaderboard.png"><figcaption>The running leaderboard lets users compare with their friends to know who is running the longest distance</figcaption></figure><p class="runtastic-leaderboard-img">Following these updates, the Runtastic app for Android was included in the Editor’s choice collection and was one of the 15 apps included in the Material Design Showcase at Google I/O 2015.</p><figure><img alt="A tablet showing Runtastic among the 'Apps with best-in-class Android design' on Google Play, and a phone showing Runtastic as number 1 app for Health & Fitness on Google Play." src="images/runtastic/runtastic-google-play.png"><figcaption>Runtastic was included in the Material Design Showcase at Google I/O 2015 (bottom left) and is the top health and fitness app in many markets (right).</figcaption></figure><h6 id="icons-and-illustrations">Icons and illustrations</h6><h3>Finding a consistent voice</h3><p>Runtastic’s imagery was quite inconsistent when I joined the company. During my time there I produced many illustrations, mostly to be used in the apps, and I led the team effort to find a new style that could be easily used by everyone in the team in a consistent way.</p><figure><img alt="Three illustrations: one with a podium, one with a beach and a volley-ball net, one with a phone with earphones" src="images/runtastic/runtastic-illustrations.png"><figcaption>Some in-app illustrations I produced for the Runtastic app.</figcaption></figure><figure class="runtastic-pattern-img"><img alt="An illustrated pattern with elements including phones, running shoes, trophies and more" src="images/runtastic/tileable-pattern.png"><figcaption>This tileable pattern for backgrounds was one of the distinctive elements of the new illustration style.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, I also designed the next evolution of the Runtastic icon set, optimizing the icons on the pixel grid and using consistent visual traits across over 100 icons.</p><figure><img alt="Four icons of the old set compared with the icons from the new set" src="images/runtastic/icons-old-new-set.png"><figcaption>Some icons from the old set (top) compared with icons from the redesigned set (bottom).

Not the same.” Runtastic had a huge featuring in this, and I worked to provide assets for printed billboards, Android.com, promotional videos, and more.</p><figure><img alt="The Android site featuring Runtastic on the home page" src="images/runtastic/runtastic-android-com.png"><figcaption>A screenshot of Android.com featuring the Runtastic app in 2015.</figcaption></figure><figure class="runtastic-london-img"><img alt="The London underground with a large Android billboard showing Runtastic" src="images/runtastic/runtastic-google-london.jpg"><figcaption>Android billboards featuring the Runtastic app in London in 2015.

The video tells the story of rapper Masta Ace, and shows how Runtastic is part of his life and the lives of many other people around the world.</p><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fruntastic%2Fvideos%2F10150665040344978%2F&width=650&show_text=false&height=343&appId" width="100%" height="343" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div></section><nav class="project-nav expanded row"><a href="/ibm" class="columns previous-project small-6"><p class="project-nav-text prev-nav-text">Previous</p><p class="project-nav-title prev-title">Being a designer at IBM</p></a><a href="/runtastic-libra" class="columns next-project small-6"><p class="project-nav-text next-nav-text">Next</p><p class="project-nav-title next-title">Runtastic Libra for Android</p></a></nav><footer class="align-justify align-middle expanded row unstack-medium"><div class="columns mail-footer small-9"><p class="get-in-touch">Get in touch:</p><a href="mailto:hello@alessiolaiso.com" id="mail">hello@alessiolaiso.com</a></div><div class="social-home"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessiolaiso" class="social-icons linkedin-icon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="LinkedIn" src="/images/home/linkedin.svg"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/AlessioLaiso" class="social-icons twitter-icon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Twitter" src="/images/home/twitter.svg"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@AlessioLaiso" class="social-icons medium-icon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Medium" src="/images/home/medium.svg"></a><p class="copyright">© 2017 Alessio Laiso</p></div></footer><script src="/js/app.js?__v=bd3e2b47467b1bfd538fa4a5f1874c5b"></script><script>ProjectTracker($,{project:"runtastic",elements:["#my-role-and-the-team","#kudos","#icons-and-illustrations","#important-featuring"]}).track()</script></body></html>
