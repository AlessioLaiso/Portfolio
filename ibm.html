In 2012, 101 years after its foundation, the tech giant started a deep corporate culture renovation, shifting towards a focus on users’ outcomes and design thinking. These are some thoughts about my role at IBM, and how my team and I are contributing to the transformation of the company.</p></div></div><div class="row project-info ibm-project"><div class="columns small-4 medium-2 medium-offset-1 large-offset-0"><h5 class="first-project-info">Company</h5><p>IBM</p></div><div class="columns small-8 medium-6 large-3"><h5>Timeframe</h5><p>Jan 2015–present</p></div><div class="columns large-7"><img class="show-for-large-only" src="images/ibm/eye-bee-m-light.svg"></div></div></header><section class="columns project-main small-12"><div class="project-story ibm-project"><small>To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I am not allowed to show more of the products I am working on.

Designing for the highly specialized users who use our products makes it hard to guess what features would work well, and highlights the importance of design research.<br><br>Together with my team, we define research objectives, conduct secondary research (articles about the space, competitor analysis, etc.), and run many rounds of user interviews. These interviews help us find the real pain points of our users, validate our assumptions, and test the usability of our designs. We also have plenty of calls with experts in different areas — technical, legal, etc. — to make sure our solutions are feasible and to improve them at each iteration.</p><figure><img alt="An empathy map full of post-it notes" src="images/ibm/empathy-map.jpg"><figcaption>Let me introduce you to Janice — and her empathy map.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="culture-and-collaboration">Culture and collaboration</h6><h3>Getting engineers to speak design</h3><p>“We know what (features) we want” is an attitude that can easily lead teams to forget what the users really need. Part of what I feel is our job as ambassadors of design in a large enterprise is getting the whole team to fully understand the value of design thinking.<br><br>IBM operates in diverse, multidisciplinary teams, which are often distributed in multiple locations and time zones. Getting an engineer on the other side of the Atlantic to trust “these designers” telling him how to make software in spite of his many years of experience can seem a daunting task. Indeed, at first some people might feel uncomfortable trying out new methodologies. What I’ve found is that, if you work together with the right spirit, eventually they’ll not only appreciate your work and the results the team is getting, but also start to explicitly request your help for new projects.</p><figure><img alt="Four IBM engineers working together around a desk" src="images/ibm/cognitive.jpg" class="first-spacer"> <img alt="Four IBM employess giving a presentation at a conference" src="images/ibm/hursley.jpg"><figcaption>For a side project, I introduced this group of non-designers to design thinking. The impact has been incredible.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="visual-design">Visual design</h6><h3>Software for security professionals can look beautiful too</h3><p>When it comes to visual design, as a designer in IBM Security I use both the IBM Design Language and the IBM Security Design Guide. Both these resources are living languages: I often prototype, test, and discuss new patterns with the rest of the team to further refine our tools. In addition to this, my passion for typography and semi-obsession for baseline grids and pixel perfection always makes me very happy to talk anything related to visual design.</p><figure class="first-spacer"><img alt="Many drafts for the branding of the cards on the IBM Security App Exchange" src="images/ibm/cards.png"><figcaption>I thought I heard you say “let’s explore a few alternatives”?</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Screenshot from an IBM Security product with all elements aligning to a grid" src="images/ibm/grid.png"><figcaption>Told you I love pixel-perfect designs with precise baseline alignments.</figcaption></figure><h6 id="sharing-knowledge">Sharing knowledge</h6><h3>Being a design ambassador inside and outside IBM</h3><p>With so much going on in design at IBM, there are many opportunities to share knowledge and tell the tale — if you're willing to. I've had the pleasure to lead many design thinking workshops for a range of people that goes from IBM engineers to 15-year-old students. I also had the chance to be a speaker at a couple of conferences. At UX Ireland I presented a study I conducted about how typography can influence user experience, and I was overwhelmed with the response. A blog post with the key findings from that study is coming very soon.</p><figure><img alt="Me speaking at a conference in a room full of people, with type elements on the screens" src="images/ibm/UX-Ireland.jpg"><figcaption>That’s me speaking at UX Ireland in November 2016.

Designers at IBM are also making their contribution, and two invention disclosures I worked on with my team have been published on ip.com (you can check them out <a href="http://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000246651D" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000247817D" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><figure><img alt="An IBM Studio, with white boards full of post-it notes" src="images/ibm/austin-studio.jpg"><figcaption>The whiteboards in the IBM Studios can get quite full of Post-it notes.
